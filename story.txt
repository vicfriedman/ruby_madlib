Once upon a time there was a ((female_profession)). She was incredibly smart and talented. She even had a super power, she could ((super_power)). This made everyone fall in love with her, left and right. One day, while she was ((verb_associated_with_profession)), she came across a huge problem. She lost her powers. She had been told by her grandmother that this would one day happen. In order to get her powers back, her grandmother told her she must go to ((foreign_country)) and find a ((random_animal)). She would know the animal because it had ((random_color)) fur. The ((random_animal)) would have to screech in her ear, and she would need to eat it's food. After that she would be better.
